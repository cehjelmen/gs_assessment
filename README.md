# gs_assessment
This set of scripts is for running through the genome size/chromosome number assessment manuscript
currently titled: Genome size and chromosome number are critical metrics for accurate genome assembly assessment in Eukaryota 

Script 1 retrieves assembly data from the Assembly (and other) NCBI databases\n
Script 2 writes genome size data (you must download from appropriate genome size databases, they are not stored here)
Script 3 writes chromosome data (you must get from appropriate chromosome databases, they are not stored here)
Script 4 writes drosophila underreplication data (data from Hjelmen et al. 2020 Evolution paper)
Script 5 generates most analyses and figures 2,3, S1, S3, S4
Script 6 Generates Figure S2, and analyses on top 20 most commonly occuring species of assemblies
Script 7 Produces Figure 1
Script 8 produces analyses related to underreplication in Drosophila and Figure 4
Script 9 Produces assessment analyses and figure 5
Script 10 produces taxonomic genome size analyses and figure s5
